## 1. Normalization Problem 
This function works by first creating a random 5x5 array using NumPy, then normalizing its values. Normalization is done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the dataset. The result is saved in _.npy_ format.

   **Code**

     import numpy as np # import the NumPy library with the 'np'

     X = np.random.rand (5, 5) # create a 5x5 array filled with random float numbers between 0 and 1
     print ("Original array X:") # label and print to indicate the original (unnormalized) array
     print (X) # print the contents of the array X

     X_normalized = (X - X.mean()) / X.std() # normalize X using the formula Z = (X - mean) / std
     print("\nNormalized array X:") # label and print to indicate that the contents are the Normalized Array
     print(X_normalized) # print the array

     np.save('X_normalized.npy', X_normalized) # save the normalized array with the file name X_normalized.npy
     print("\nNormalized array saved as 'X_normalized.npy'") # print to confirm that the file has been saved

  **Output**
    
    Original array X:
    [[0.1776342  0.57704216 0.23915709 0.96082686 0.73985412]
     [0.4339007  0.05191411 0.61247685 0.54095802 0.67134365]
     [0.12890651 0.06126694 0.18407051 0.31359245 0.80190885]
     [0.87789692 0.53974643 0.81134419 0.37634833 0.77633622]
     [0.53949434 0.75783353 0.42785424 0.65036754 0.46056141]]

    Normalized array X:
    [[-1.27594555  0.26429953 -1.03869359  1.74429631  0.89215463]
     [-0.28769981 -1.76076253  0.40094704  0.1251475   0.6279563 ]
     [-1.46385513 -1.72469499 -1.25112509 -0.75164698  1.13145756]
     [ 1.42449191  0.12047526  1.16784325 -0.50964018  1.03284127]
     [ 0.11950311  0.96148898 -0.31101691  0.54706567 -0.18488756]]

    Normalized array saved as 'X_normalized.npy'

  **Conclusion**

To conclude, I created a NumPy program that generates a random 5x5 array and normalizes it using the formula (X - mean) / std. The mean was obtained using .mean() and the standard deviation using .std(). Finally, the normalized array was saved into a .npy file using np.save(). This technique is useful in data preprocessing, ensuring values are scaled consistently.


## 2. Divisible by 3 Problem 
This function works by creating a 10x10 NumPy array of the squares of the first 100 positive integers. After forming the matrix, the program filters and prints all the numbers divisible by 3, and then saves them into a _.npy_ file.

   **Code**

    A = (np.arange(1, 101) ** 2).reshape(10, 10) # square each element then reshape the result into a 10x10 2D array which is a matrix
    print("Array A (squares of first 100 integers):") # label and print the matrix
    print(A) # print the contents of the matrix

    div_by_3 = A[A % 3 == 0] # find all elements in the matrix that are divisible by 3
    print("\nElements divisible by 3:") # label and print to indicate the elements that are divisible by 3
    print(div_by_3) # print all the values that are divisible by 3

    np.save('div_by_3.npy', div_by_3) # save the values that are divisible by 3 with the file name div_by_3.npy
    print("\nDivisible by 3 elements saved as 'div_by_3.npy'") # print to confirm that the file has been saved

  **Output**

    Array A (squares of first 100 integers):
    [[    1     4     9    16    25    36    49    64    81   100]
